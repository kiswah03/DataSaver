# DataSaver
Data Saver is a parental control app that ensures your teen doesn’t
hog all the data in your family cell phone plan. It lets you block Wi-Fi and
cellular data on your teens’ phone when the line has used a specified
amount of data. The app automatically cuts off the line’s data. You can also
set time limit with Data Saver to control the time spend by your teen on the
internet.
